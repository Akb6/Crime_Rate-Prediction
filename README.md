# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Rate Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict crime rates using machine learning algorithms such as **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression**, based on historical crime data. The model can help understand crime trends and assist authorities in proactive decision-making.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Crime is a serious issue that affects the quality of life and safety of communities. Accurate prediction of crime rates can:
- Help in resource planning for law enforcement agencies
- Identify high-risk areas
- Enable strategic interventions to reduce crime

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Linear Regression**  
  For establishing a baseline and understanding linear trends in the dataset.

- **Random Forest Regressor**  
  To capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy with ensemble learning.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **R-squared (R²) Score**  
- **Cross-validation** to ensure model generalizability

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn
